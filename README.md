# ERSwift

You can try out this project at: http://www.erswift.com/#/

Our team of 2 has had some bad experiences with emergency room wait times. One of us broke our arm and had to wait over 4 hours, the other waited 2 hours to get stitches above the eye. We decided to make ERSwift to ensure that nobody else had to go through the anxiety and pain we did. 

This application is also inspired by the alarming amount of COVID-19 cases in hospitals. These cases have made hospitals clogged and inefficient.

ERSwift uses an automated Triage identification system to "diagnose" patients and direct them towards different sections of the hospital. Patients are put in a queue, allowing them to not need to wait at the hospital. This app also allows doctors to see where patients are in the hospital, and where resources are needed.


## Creators

This project was created by Brian Han and Eugene Fei.

Brian Han: Program

Eugene Fei: Design and Video Editing


## Future Plans

We hope that we can implement more complex features into the app, including photo submissions, machine-learning algorithms to determine severity/diagnosis, etc. We also hope to work with a hospital or medical professional to better understand the flow of hospitals, and work together to create a fully automated system.
